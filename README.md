# MPI_2021-2022

* The year 2020 and 2021 must be tough for many people around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially for international students like me, after the situation escalated, almost all of my classmates fled back to their homeland. However, studying and working abroad has always been my dream, and I don't want to give it up easily. Fortunately, I got a job a few months after graduating from QMUL and stayed in the UK.
